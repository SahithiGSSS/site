The VREYE project aims to widen the scope of VR software systems in the medical domain and loops in various benefits of the technology in order to solve the problems that persist in the scope of testing and detection.

The project is partially funded by Google (GCP credits).

VR is used for Visual acuity testing of myopia and astigmatic eyes and can be used in providing a piece of tentative information about the refractive errors in the human eye using HMD devices.

The goals of the project is to:

1. Provide a visual acuity testing solution to the underprivileged and post COVID-19 pandemic to serve as a remote, user-friendly, safe testing kit for personal usage where the patients are not required to flock hospitals for minor testing and diagnosis purposes for refractive errors in eye.
2. This project may be expanded in future in areas like color-blindness and other eye-related ailments.
3. This project has been developed specifically using Unity in order to make it compatible with various VR specific platforms.
4. Aimed to digitize and automate the various eye-testing methods like Snellen Test (for myopia detection), Fan Test (for astigmatism detection) and with sufficient user data predict to the closest value possible what could be the refractive indexes of patients using the system.
